# 2048 Sliding Tile Game for the O Watch / TinyScreen+

The O Watch is an open source Arduino based smart watch kit designed for kids to create their own watch and learn the basics of coding, 3D design, and band making. http://theowatch.com/

Use the four O Watch buttons to slide the tiles horizontally or vertically. 
Combine similar tiles to reach 2048 and beyond.

This sliding tile game was inspired by the 2048 game by Gabriele Cirulli
